                A passionate problem solver. Love to learn new things and technology. Passionate about making things precisely accurate. Love to work behind amazing innovations.<br><br>
                I am a dedicated Software Engineer with a strong foundation in competitive programming and a passion for creating innovative solutions. My journey began at Shahjalal University of Science And Technology, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics while actively participating and excelling in competitive programming contests like ACM-ICPC, Codeforces, and CodeChef.<br><br>
                Following my academic pursuits, I brought my programming prowess to LiiLab, where I served as a Software Engineer. During my tenure, I successfully architected and developed the Intro Maker app, showcasing my skills in leveraging Canvas and Native Android APIs. This endeavor resulted in an impressive milestone of over 100k downloads on the Play Store. Additionally, I optimized GkQuiz's rank list functionality, utilizing Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore to achieve a remarkable 4x performance boost, attracting a substantial user base.<br><br>
                Currently, I am contributing my expertise to BrainCraft Ltd. as a Software Engineer. In this role, I have designed and implemented key features, such as an Image to Video module, using OpenGLES and MediaCodec API. My contributions have led to over 250,000 downloads on the Google Play Store.<br><br>
                Throughout my journey, I've honed my skills in various programming languages, databases, and machine learning frameworks. My commitment to excellence extends beyond my professional endeavors, as I actively engage in voluntary activities, serving as a Moderator & Trainer at Euclid Programming Club and contributing as an Admin and Executive at Shuddho Social Organization.<br><br>
